Developer Handoff — Project Instructions
🔹 Overview

This project includes reference code files and design inspirations.
👉 Important: The code in the files is NOT final. It is only for AI-feeding / structure reference. The final implementation must match the design layouts shown in the Figma/UI images, with improved UI where needed.

Your job is to:

Follow the exact layout as shown in the design.

Improve the visual quality (subtle UI, cleaner spacing, better typography).

Do not add or change functionality beyond what is listed.

Build a super user-friendly experience focusing on clarity and simplicity.

🔹 Key Rules
1. Layout must remain the same

Do not change structure or placements from the provided design.

Only improve visually (spacing, typography, consistency, hierarchy).

Navigation layout seen in reference code may be different — follow the design, not the code.

2. Code in the file is NOT final

Treat it as resource code only.

Refactor and rebuild UI for better readability and usability.

Ensure all screens follow consistent:

Viewport sizing

Typography

Padding & margins

Component spacing

Color usage

Icons

3. Keep UI minimal, clean, subtle

Apple-style soft shadowing

Thin outline icons

Balanced spacing

Uniform corner radii

Soft color palette as per design

Don’t overload screens with elements

🔹 Core Feature: Multi-Step User Form

Create a super-friendly, guided, spoon-feeding flow for user onboarding.
It should collect the following information:

Basic Details

Full Name

Phone Number

Email

Date of Birth

Height

Weight

Medical Questions (Yes/No + Optional detail field)

Do you have Diabetes? (Type 1 / Type 2)

High Blood Pressure?

Cholesterol issues?

Any surgeries?

For women:

PCOD/PCOS?

Any gynecological surgery?

Joint or bone-related injuries?

Any chronic diseases?

Any other medical conditions?

UX Requirements

Each question should be simple, one-by-one or grouped cleanly.

Use:

Toggle switches

Radio buttons

Simple inputs

Optional textarea if they choose "Yes"

Provide progress indication (ex: Step 1/5)

🔹 Output After Form Completion

After the user fills the form:

1. Personalized Workout Plan

Tailored to medical restrictions

Organized by:

Beginner / intermediate

Weekly schedule

Rest days

Simple, accurate, safe exercises

Clear formatting

2. Personalized Meal Plan

Based on:

Weight goals

Health issues (BP, diabetes, PCOS, etc.)

Veg / non-veg preference

Clean card layout

Easy-to-read meals (Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner / Snacks)

UI Requirements for Plans

Use clear section cards

Soft shadows

Suitable spacing

Simple icons

Easy to scan and understand

🔹 Page Instructions

Every page in the project:

Follow the inspiration design

The page templates included in the project folder are only structure references.

The final UI must:

Match the design’s layout

Improve visually

Stay minimal and modern

Accessibility

Large touch targets

Legible font sizes

Clear contrast

Smooth navigation

🔹 Navigation Instructions

Since code navigation and design navigation differ:

IGNORE navigation behavior found in the code

FOLLOW navigation placement shown in the design

Use:

Smooth transitions

Clear highlighted states

Consistent icons and spacing

🔹 Developer Notes

The design is the source of truth.

Code is not final and must be restructured.

UI must be:

Simple

Clean

Functional

Visually refined

Avoid unnecessary animations or complicated interactions.

✔ Final Goal

Deliver a beautiful, clean, user-friendly app that:

Follows the design layout exactly

Provides accurate exercise & meal suggestions

Makes onboarding simple and smooth

Has consistent UI across all pages
